# Exercise 1: Social Networks.

A **social network** is a social structure made of individuals (or organizations) called **nodes**, which are tied (**connected**) by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige.

A **graph** is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called **vertices**, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called **edges**.

The exercise consists of:

1.    implementing the social network as a graph, i.e., to define the graph data structure with the operations you consider necessary to implement a social network
2.    implementing an operation that visits in a convenient way all the elements of the graph
3.    testing it against a dummy social network.
