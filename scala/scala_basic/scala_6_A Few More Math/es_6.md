Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics. It states:

Every even integer greater than 2 is a Goldbach number, i.e., a number that can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

Expressing a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of the number. For example,

04 = 2 +  2           6 = 3 +  3           8 = 3 +  5

10 = 7 +  3          12 = 5 +  7          14 = 3 + 11

16 = 5 + 11          18 = 7 + 11          20 = 7 + 13

Write the following functions:

*    `goldbach(n)` that returns a Goldbach partition for n
*    `goldbach_list(n,m)` that returns a list of Goldbach partitions for the even numbers in the range `(n,m)`.
