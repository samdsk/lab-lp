# Exercise 3: Matrix Calculi.

* Write the matrix datatype with the following operations:

1.    A function `zeroes` to construct a matrix of size n×m filled with zeros.
2.    A function `identity` to construct the identity matrix (the one with all 0s but the 1s on the diagonal) of given size.
3.    A function `init` to construct a square matrix of a given size n filled with the first n×n integers.
4.    A function `transpose` that transposes a generic matrix independently of its size and content.
5.    The basics operators `+` and `*` that adds and multiplies two matrices non necessarily squared.
