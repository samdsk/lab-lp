# Exercise 4: Frequencies.

* Let's write a function (or a pool of functions) that given a quite large text (over than 2000 words) counts how frequent each word occurs in the text.

* The text is read from a file (look at the `pervasive` module in the manual) and it is a real text with punctuation (i.e., commas, semicolons, ...) that should be counted.

**Note** that words with different case should be considered the same.
