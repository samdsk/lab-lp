# Exercise 6: Approximated Trigonometric Functions.

### sin(x) can be approximate by the Taylor's series:

* Similarly you can approximate all the trigonometric and transcendent functions (look at:[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)).

Let's write a module to implement `sin x n` by using the **Taylor's series** (where `n` is the level of approximation, i.e., 1 only one item, 2 two items, 3 three items and so on). Do the same with **cosine**, **tangent**, **logarithm** and so on.

Let's compare your functions with those implemented in the `pervasive` module at the growing of the approximation level.
