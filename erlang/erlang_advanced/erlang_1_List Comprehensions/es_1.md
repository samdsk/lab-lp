Write the following functions by using list comprehensions:

`squared_int` that removes all non-integers from a polymorphic list and returns the resulting list of integers squared, e.g., `squared_int([1, hello, 100, boo, “boo”, 9]) should return [1, 10000, 81]`.
`intersect` that given two lists, returns a new list that is the intersection of the two lists `(e.g., intersect([1,2,3,4,5], [4,5,6,7,8]) should return [4,5])`.
`symmetric_difference` that given two lists, returns a new list that is the symmetric difference of the two lists. For example `symmetric_difference([1,2,3,4,5], [4,5,6,7,8])` should return `[1,2,3,6,7,8]`.
